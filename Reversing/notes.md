# **Reverse Engineering**

## **Notes**:
- **Static analysis**: In this approach, we do not execute the executable. Instead, we use specialized tools and prior knowledge to infer several useful information about the executable.
- **Dynamic analysis**: In this approach, we execute the executable and observe its behaviour during execution, using a different set of specialized tools. By observing its behaviour, we can infer useful information about the executable.
